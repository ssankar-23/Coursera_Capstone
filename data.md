# Battle of the Neighborhoods - Data: <p>Comparison of the Communities in Trinidad and Tobago</p>

### Data
As Trinidad and Tobago is such a small country, updated information is very difficult to find, with not much being made available for use. The data for this project will consist of:
  * **Community / Municipality Data** - Names of communities and population data scraped from the City Population site (https://www.citypopulation.de/en/trinidad/admin/) and cross referenced with data from the Central Statistics Office of Trinidad and Tobago.
  * **Geocoder Location Data** - From `geopy` used to retrieve the location data for each community.
  * **Foursquare API Information** - To explore the venues available for each community in Trinidad and Tobago and collect their location information.
  * **Crime Statistics** - Total reported serious crimes for 2018 sourced from the Central Statistics Office of Trinidad and Tobago (https://cso.gov.tt/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Total-Number-of-Serious-Crimes-by-Police-Division-Station-2018.xls.xls). The list of serious crimes in this list consists of murder, shootings, sexual offences, kidnapping, burglaries, robberies, fraud, larceny, narcotics, possession of firearms, etc.
  * **.GEOJSON Data** - The .geojson file used in this project was created by myself as none was available.
