# Battle of the Neighborhoods - Introduction / Business Problem: Comparison of Communities in Trinidad and Tobago

### Description of the Problem
Trinidad and Tobago, though small in area, is a developing nation, and is eager to invest in companies or businesses that are willing to be opened no matter the type, in an effort to stimulate and diversify the economy. In light of the current economic crisis associated with the fallout from COVID-19, businesses must be smart in choosing their locations, in order to get a good start at success. The aim of this project will be to determine where would be the best place to open a business in Trinidad and Tobago by comparing the top ten (10) venues for each community.

### Introduction
The twin island nation of Trinidad and Tobago is located within the Caribbean, West Indies. It is a developing nation with the third highest GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP) in the Americas after the United States and Canada (_World Economic Outlook Database, October 2017_). The country has a population of approximately 1,363,985 people, covering an estimated 5100 km<sup>2</sup> which leads to a population density of 273 per km<sup>2</sup>. This value, however, varies greatly for each community or city.

The majority of the population within Trinidad (the larger of the two), lies within the more urban areas located in the western part of the country. These also correspond to a higher number of businesses in these areas. Even though Trinidad and Tobago has the potential to be a booming country for the business community, Trinidad and Tobago, however, has over the last few decades, a very high crime rate with murder rates near to or crossing 500 each year for the past decade. This has the potential to ruin a business, especially one that is newly established. As such, many investors have been turned off from the idea of starting a business. Therefore, it is imperative this must be factored in when determining the location of a business.
